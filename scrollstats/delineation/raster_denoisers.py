Contains all functions responsible for denoising an input binary array ("denoiser functions") to more accurately represent the ridge and swale areas
Ridge areas will correspond to a value of True or 1, swale areas will correspond to a value of False or 0

Denoiser functions take a BinaryArray2D and any other kwargs as input and return a BinaryArray2D as output

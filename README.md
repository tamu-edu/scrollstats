<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

An open-source python library to calculate and extract morphometrics from
scrollbar floodplains.

## Getting Started

**Create conda environment**

Create a conda environment from the provided `environment.yml` file with the
following commands

```shell
# Navigate to the install location of scrollstats
cd path/to/scrollstats

# Create the environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## The ScrollStats Workflow

The ScrollStats Workflow can be broken up into the 3 major steps listed below.
Each of these steps is covered in detail in [docs](docs/) with code examples
using datasets generated from
[a bend on the Lower Brazos River, TX](https://www.google.com/maps/@30.614411,-96.499508,16z).

### 1. [Delineate Ridge Areas](docs/DelineateRidgeAreas.md)

Delineate ridge areas from a DEM to create the ridge area raster. This is
achieved by:

1. applying the profile curvature and residual topography transforms to the DEM
2. applying a threshold at 0 to these transformed rasters to create binary
   rasters
3. finding the union of these binary rasters
4. denoising the union raster

### 2. [Create Vector Datasets](docs/CreateVectorDatasets.md)

Create the following vector datasets to define key morphological features of the
bend.

- bend boundary
- packet boundaries
- channel centerline
- ridge lines
- migration pathways

Some of these datasets are digitized manually, while others are generated by
ScrollStats. Details of the vector data creation process can be found in the doc
linked above.

### 3. [Calculate Ridge Metrics](docs/CalculateRidgeMetrics.md)

Once all of the vector datasets are created and the raster areas are delineated,
you can now calculate ridge metrics across the entire bend.

These metrics include ridge amplitude, width, and migration distance for every
intersection of a ridge and migration pathway.

## Contributing

Contribution to ScrollStats is welcome. There will forever be a "frozen" branch
that contains the code exactly as it was at the time of publication, but it is
the intent of the maintainer to accept community feedback and suggestions to the
project.

**Submitting Feedback** To submit feedback, please open an issue on this
repository with the appropriate label. Currently used labels are:

- `documentation`: issues concerning the workflow or clarity of instructions
- `feature`: issues requesting or proposing new features for scrollstats
- `bug`: issues concerning errors in the code itself
